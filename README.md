# Tableau_SQL_Dashboard

# ❇️INTRODUCTION ❇️
This is a mini Project from the MYSQL course which I completed a few days back. This project helped me to learn how to add SQL with Tableau to solve the problem of the company and give them solutions with the help of Insightful Dashboard in Tableau.



# 🎯 OBJECTIVE 🎯

1️⃣ Create a visualization that provides a breakdown of the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

2️⃣ Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

3️⃣ Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until the year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per department.

4️⃣ Create an SQL-stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.
 Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure. Finally, visualize the obtained result set in Tableau as a double bar chart.



# 💡INSIGHTS 💡

✅ This visualization allows us to see right away that in 1990 there were less than 20,000 workers in the company, while in 2002, just 12 years later, there were more than 140,000. However, the increase in the number of employed workers throughout the years has been constant, and the ratio between male and female employees in the company has always been 60 to 40% approximately.

✅ We infer that in the given time period, the salaries values have been augmenting constantly for any department. Moreover, the average salaries 
of male and female employees were similar until 1993, and after that male employees were paid more with a few thousand dollars difference per year.
